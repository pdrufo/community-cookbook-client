# Community Cookbook
Welcome to the Community Cookbook. A place where users can browse some of my favorite recipes, whether they are a weeknight go-to or dinner party ready. Users may also post some of their favorite recipes too. Hopefully, we'll never be stuck again on the question "What's for dinner"?
